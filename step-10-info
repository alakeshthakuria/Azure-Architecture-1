The DNS resolver sends back the private IP [x.x.x.x] to our laptop through the VPN tunnel.

our on-prem device now knows the destination IP [x.x.x.x]

So when you try to access https://storageaccountfordemolab.blob.core.windows.net, our system sends packets to the private IP of the storage account’s Private Endpoint.

Because our laptop is connected via the Point-to-Site VPN, all traffic for Azure VNet addresses (like x.x.x.x) goes through the VPN tunnel.

So  the packets automatically flow through the VPN tunnel, which terminates at the Virtual Network Gateway (inside the Gateway Subnet).

The VPN Gateway forwards this traffic to the target private IP (x.x.x.x) — which is the network interface (NIC) of your Private Endpoint, located in the PrivateEndpointSubnet.
